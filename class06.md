# Random Module

- The random modules allows you to generate random numbers
- Randint:
    - Use: Random integers
    - Accepts two parameters, a lowest & highest number
    - The 1st value should be less than the 2nd.

- Choice:
    - Use: Random value from the sequence sequence.

- Shuffle:
    - Use: Shuffles the elements in a list

- Randrange:
    Use: Randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

# Risk Analysis in Software Testing

- Risk is the probability of any unwanted incident.
- In software risk analysis is figuring out what is the risks in applications of software that you built and prioritizing them.
- Some possible risks:
    1. Use of new hardware
    2. Use of new technology
    3. Use of new automation
    4. Change in the sequence of the code
    5. Availability of test recources for the application
- Some unavoidable risks:
    - The time that you allocated for testing
    - A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application
    - Urgency from the clients to deliver the project
    - Incomplete requirements
- **The perspective of Risk Assessment:**
    1. Effect: To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.
    2. Cause: To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that
    3. Likelihood: To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement wonâ€™t be satisfied.

# Test Coverage

- It's used to find the untested parts of the codebase, and it measures how good your tests are.
- The quality of testing codes must be sufficient, it's not just about covering a 100% of the tests.
