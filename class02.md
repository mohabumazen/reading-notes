# Tests

## Uni Tests
- Uni tests is a test to obtain how the input and output will be of a code. 
- TDD : Test Driven Development is a strategy of testing, it's about crafting the software design first.
- The test name should be considered as your alive documentation
- The test file name should follow the same name of module name.
- Test files should be in a seprate folder 

> **Note:** if __name__ == “main”: is used to execute some code only if the script was run directly, and not imported. And if you import the script in another file as a module the __name__ will be the module name.

# Recurrsion
- The process in which the function calls itself directly or indirectly. 
- One of the advantages of using it is: to write less code and make the code more easy to write and read.
- The recurrsion function terminates when the base case becomes True. 
- Every recurssive call needs extra space in the stack memory 
- Infinate recurssion calls may lead to over stack in memory
- Examples of Recursive algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Tower of Hanoi, Fibonacci Series, Factorial Problem.
