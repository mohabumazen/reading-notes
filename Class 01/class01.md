" Suffering is dependent on the story that we layer on top of our pain"

- **My perspective :** Data Science considers science and, consequently, the scientific method to promote decision making through data intelligence.

- **Why are you doing this?** The main goal of taking this course is to gain the foundation of the software development and fill the gaps, before reaching the goal of being a Data Scientist.

- **Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?** Yes indeed

- **Are you doing this for you?** Yes, this is my journey and path, so I should be the one putting the effort for it to successed.

# Big O notations

- Big O is an algorthim that describes the time needed to execute an algorthim. Also, it specifies the worst-case scenario.

- O( l ): algorthim executes in the same time.
- O( N ): algorthim performance grows lineraly with the size of the input.
- O( N ^ 2): algorthim performance proportional to the square of the input.
- O(2 ^ N): algorthim performance doubles with each addition to the input.


# Notes for setup python environment

- Use poetry for dependencies managment 
- Constant formatting & redability using Black tool

- Use mypy for error checking
